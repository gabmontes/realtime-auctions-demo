# Realtime auctions demo

This is a realtime auctions server based on Node.JS, Express and Socket.IO, along with a web client based on React and Socket.IO too, of course!

## Running the demo

Clone the repo and run `npm start`. Then, open a browser at [http://127.0.0.1:4000]() and play with it!.

Enjoy!

## Next steps

On the server side:

- Implement auctions CRUD and persist all auctions data.
- Implement controls to start and finish auctions.
- Implement sessions to recognize users after a web client refresh.
- Implement simultaneous auctions.
- Implement user's authentication.

On the client:

- Implement building of web client's source to remove parsing jsx on the fly.
- Implement authentication forms.
- Implement Flux or another architecture.
